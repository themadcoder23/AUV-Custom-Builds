<p>The Colour - shape combo detection using OpenCV library has been dropped!!!!</p><br>
<p>Features:</p><br>
<p>1) Detects a specific Colour - Shape combo based on the keyboard controls with a great accuracy. </p><br>
<p>2) No need for GUI, making code lighter with minimal possibility of errors.</p><br>
<p>3) Highly efficient code using less memory and operates with a great speed.</p><br>
<br>
<p>Just one important thing: To run all the upcoming programs(based on OpenCV), you will need a Virtual Environment to your folder.</p><br><br>
<p>So if you don't have one on your system, you can create it using the python documentation link given below.</p>
<p>Also don't forget to have OpenCV as well as NumPy on your system :).</p>
<p>More programs dropping soon.</p>
